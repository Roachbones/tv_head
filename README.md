# TV Head
Arduino code for [my LED respirator costume project](https://rose.systems/tv_head#respirator). Controlled via Bluetooth, plays animations on the LED matrix. Runs on a Adafruit Feather M0 Bluefruit LE.

Like my TV head code, but adjusted to fit the smaller respirator screen. Refactored to be friendlier to different resolutions. (Also combined into one file because so many people got confused by the concept of an Arduino sketch comprised of multiple files.)
